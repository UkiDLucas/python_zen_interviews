# # Readability over compactness
# 
# In Python community, including the official documentation and examples, there is **a tendency to use most compact and esoteric syntax possible, that does not serve anyone**. I, as a hiring manager, do not want to hire people who pride themselves in writing an unreadable code. This tendency also shows immaturity, the orgin of that tendency can be two-fold: 
# 
# - the original authors were loner-hacker types that only cared to write a short scripts that served themselves
# - the original authors were academics that never worked for an extended amount of time in a large team
# 
# Maintaining an unreadable code is a nightmare and often it is easier to re-write it from scratch.
# 
# Finally, I believe the code should be self-commenting and comments should be used only when the developer exhausts all possible opitions to make their code more readable.
# 
# The classes and functions should have description and examples of how should they be used.

# # Python naming conventions (PEP8 compliant)
# 
# 
# - **Packages** (directory name) should have short, **all-lowercase** names, underscores are discouraged.
# - **Modules** (source file name) should have short, **all-lowercase** names, underscores can be used. 
# - **Classes** should normally use the **CapWords** convention.
# - **Constants** should be written in **UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES**
# - **Variables** should be written in **lower_case_with_underscores**
